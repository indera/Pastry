# Pastry

Implementation of Pastry distributed object location service for finding and sharing data over a distributed peer network

A distributed hash table (DHT) is a class of decentralized distributed systems that provide a lookup service
similar to a hash table; (key, value) pairs are stored in a DHT, and any participating node can efficiently retrieve
the value associated with a given key. The value might be records, files, etc.
